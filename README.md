vibe code a smart disk monitor in bash

There is no need for any of this at all.  

Background story, I bought a 6 drive thunderbolt from ebay for two hundred notes.  

It came with 24T, I wanted to quickly write a bash script to see what state the drives were in.  

I vibe coded.  

This is the result.
