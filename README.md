There is no need for any of this.  Not at all.  

Background story, I bought a 6 drive thunderbolt from ebay for two hundred notes.  

It came with 24T, I wanted to quickly write a bash script to see what state the drives were in.  

I vibe coded.  Turns out the disks were mostly fine.

This is the result:

```
asciinema rec --overwrite smart.asc
asciinema convert --overwrite -f asciicast-v2 smart.asc smart.cast
agg smart.cast smart.gif
```
